# Problem Statement

**Urban air quality monitoring remains critically blind-spotted: physical sensor networks cover less than 2% of city streets due to prohibitive hardware costs ($5,000-$15,000 per unit), lengthy deployment cycles, and ongoing maintenance burdens, leaving millions of residents without localized pollution data essential for public health decisions.**
